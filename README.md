# WindowsPerf

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

Take the Linux perf tool and port it to Windows on Arm with the same command line interface so that you can do deep performance analysis.

Currently we support:
* **counting model**, for obtaining aggregate counts of occurrences of special events, and
* **sampling model**, for determining the frequencies of event occurrences produced by program locations at the function, basic block, and/or instruction levels. Sampling model features include:
  * sampling mode initial merge, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/111
  * support for DLL symbol resolution, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/132
  * deduce from command line image name and PDB file name, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/134
  * stop sampling when sampled process ends, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/135

## Modules

WindowsPerf solution consists of two projects:
* `wperf` is a perf-like user space command line interface tool.
* `wperf-driver` is a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) driver.
  * See [Using WDF to Develop a Driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-the-framework-to-develop-a-driver) article for more details on KMDF.

`wperf` application communicates with `wperf-driver` via I/O buffer. Proprietary binary protocol is used to exchange data, commands and status between two.

Currently `wperf-driver` can communicate with one instance of `wperf`.

# Building WindowsPerf project

Currently WindowsPerf is targeted for Windows on Arm devices. Both, user space `wperf` application and Kernel-mode driver `wperf-driver` are `ARM64EC` and `ARM64` binaries respectively.

Currently both projects `wperf` and `wperf-driver` in WindowsPerf solution are configured for cross compilation. You can build WindowsPerf natively on `ARM64` machines but please note that native compilation may be still wobbly due to constant improvements to WDK Kit.

Please build `wperf` application with `ARM64EC` configuration as it's requiring DIA SDK support which is not available in `ARM64` mode.

## Project requirements

### Toolchain and software kits

* [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
 * Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).
* [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

Please note that SDK and WDK versions installed on your system must be compatible! First install Windows SDK using Visual Studio installer and after itâ€™s installed proceed and install WDK which must match DSK version so that first three numbers of the version are the same. For example, SDK version `10.0.22621.1` and WDK `10.0.22621.382` is a match.

### Codebase

WindowsPerf solution is implemented in `C/C++17`.

### Debugging Kernel-Mode driver

You can see `wperf-driver` debug printouts with [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview). Kernel-Mode debug prints are produced with macros [DbgPrint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprint) and [DbgPrintEx](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprintex).

After adding sampling model we've moved to more robust tracing. For kernel driver traces please use [TraceView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/traceview) application. You will need to present TraceView with `wperf-driver.pdb` file and you are ready to go!

Debugging Tools for Windows supports kernel debugging over a USB cable using EEM on an Arm device. Please refer to [Setting Up Kernel-Mode Debugging over USB EEM on an Arm device using KDNET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/setting-up-kernel-mode-debugging-over-usb-eem-arm-kdnet) article for more details.

### Creating Reliable Kernel-Mode Drivers

To create a reliable kernel-mode driver, follow these [guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/creating-reliable-kernel-mode-drivers).

## Build solution from command line

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Build "Debug|ARM64EC"
```

For more information regarding `devenv` and its command line options visit [Devenv command-line switches](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches?view=vs-2022).


## Build specific project in the solution

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Rebuild "Debug|ARM64EC" /Project wperf\wperf.vcxproj
```

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Rebuild "Debug|ARM64" /Project wperf-driver\wperf-driver.vcxproj
```

## Makefile

You can issue project build commands, project cleanup and documentation generation using GNU `make`. `Makefile` with popular commands is located in the solution directory.
Please note that for documentation generation you would need `Doxygen` installed on your system.

### Below few useful commands

| Action | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| Rebuild whole solution | `> make all` |
| Rebuild `wperf` project | `> make wperf` |
| Rebuild `wperf-driver` project | `> make wperf-driver`  |
| Rebuild `wperf-test` project | `> make wperf-test`  |
| Rebuild `wperf`, `wperf-test` projects and run unit tests  | `> make test`  |
| Solution clean up | `> make clean`  |
| Create binary release packages | `> make release`  |
| Remove all build directories (deep clean)  | `> make purge`  |
