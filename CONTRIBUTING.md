# Contributing Guidelines

# Basic guidelines

All changes you commit or submit by pull request should follow these simple guidelines:
- Use pull requests.
- Solution and project you've modified should build without new warnings or errors.
- Please do not squash your Pull Request commits into one commit. Split PR into many meaningful commits, we can review separately.
- Code should be free from profanities in any language.

# Pull requests

1. Clear and Descriptive Title: Use a concise and informative title that summarizes the changes made.
2. Detailed Description: Provide a detailed description of what the pull request does, why the changes are necessary, and any relevant context.
3. Reference Issues: Link to any related issues or tickets to provide context and traceability.
4. Small and Focused Changes: Keep pull requests small and focused on a single task or feature to make them easier to review.
5. Code Review Checklist: Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards, includes necessary tests, and has been tested locally.
6. Request Reviews: Tag relevant team members or reviewers to get their feedback and approval.
7. Respond to Feedback: Address any comments or suggestions from reviewers promptly and respectfully.
8. Update Documentation: If your changes affect documentation, make sure to update it accordingly.
9. Automated Checks: Ensure that all automated checks and tests pass before requesting a review.
10. Commit Messages: Write clear and meaningful commit messages that explain the changes made in each commit.

Following these practices can help streamline the review process and improve the quality of your contributions. Let me know if you need any more information!

## Advice on pull requests

- Applying the single responsibility principle to pull requests is always a good idea. Try not to include some additional stuff into the pull request. For example, do not fix any typos other than your current context or do not add a tiny bug fix to a feature.
- Title and description is the first place where you can inform other developers about the changes.
- Description of a pull request should always be prepared with the same attention, whether the pull request has a small or huge change.
- Always think that anybody could read your pull request anytime.
- You should build your code and test (if possible) before creating the pull request.
- Both reviewers and the author should be polite in the comments.

Other:
- The source branch must be rebased onto the target branch.
- Members who can merge are allowed to add commits to pull requests.

## Commits in your pull requests

- One commit should represent one meaningful change. E.g. Please do not add a new header file and in the same commit update project solution.
- Have short (72 chars or less) meaningful subjects.
- Have a useful subject prefixed (E.g.: `"wperf: Refactor header files"`). See next chapter for details.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Wrap lines at 72 characters if possible (E.g.: URLs are very hard to wrap).
- Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.

Good commit message examples can be found [here](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages).

### Commit message prefixes

| Prefix | Code change |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| `wperf`               | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf` directory. |
| `wperf-common`        | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-common` directory. |
| `wperf-devgen`        | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-devgen` directory. |
| `wperf-driver`        | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-driver` directory. |
| `wperf-scripts`       | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-scripts` directory. |
| `wperf-lib`           | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-lib` directory. |
| `wperf-lib-app`       | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-lib-app` directory. |
| `wperf-lib-c-compat`  | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-lib-app\wperf-lib-c-compat` directory. |
| `wperf-lib-timeline`  | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-lib-app\wperf-lib-timeline` directory. |
| `wperf-test`          | Changes to files in `windowsperf\wperf-test` directory. |
| `docs`                | Changes to documentation (E.g.: `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`). |
| `sln`                 | Changes to solution files `windowsperf.sln`. |
| `other`               | Changes to other files (E.g.: `.gitignore`, `Makefile`). |

You can group prefixes in your commit message subject (E.g.: `"wperf-common,docs: Add new header"`).

Example of correctly prefixed commits:
```
* 8857b6c wperf-scripts: fix missing jsonschema from requirements
* 1790de1 wperf: Remove backslashes from help message
* 86443ad wperf-driver: Do not free core_info if it's a NULL pointer
```

# If you have commit access

- Do NOT use `git push --force` on `main` branch.
- Use pull requests to suggest changes to other maintainers.

# Code style preferences

Most of the code style preferences are defined in project solution (`.sln`) and/or project files attached to this project (`.vcxproj`).

To learn more about how to define code style settings per-project see article [Code style preferences](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/code-styles-and-code-cleanup?view=vs-2022).

You can read more about how to create reliable Windows Kernel Drivers, just follow these [guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/creating-reliable-kernel-mode-drivers).

# Testing your changes

You should test your code locally before you submit a patch.

- If you are modifying `wperf` project please (if possible) add new unit tests that will cover new functions you've added. Unit test project for `wperf` is [wperf-test](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf/tree/main/wperf-test). See `wperf-test` [README.md](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf/blob/main/wperf-test/README.md) for more details on how to write and run the tests. Unit tests isolate and exercise specific units of your code (functions). You should split your code in such a way that core functionality shouldn't be depending on e.g. user interface. Those functions can be unit tested. See examples of unit tests for [utils](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf/blob/main/wperf-test/wperf-test-utils.cpp) functions for inspiration.

- You should also run regression tests using [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/) library and corresponding Python test scripts we've provided with [wperf-scripts/tests](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf/tree/main/wperf-scripts/tests). See `wperf-scripts/tests` [README.md](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf/blob/main/wperf-scripts/tests/README.md) for more details.

- Make sure to run our stress test for at least 5 interactions. Detailed instructions can be found here [wperf-scripts/tests](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf/tree/main/wperf-scripts/tests).

# Reporting Bugs

A good bug report, which is complete and self-contained, enables us to fix the bug. Before  you report a bug, please check the list of [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/Linaro/WindowsPerf/-/issues) and, if possible, try a bleeding edge code (latest source tree commit).
 
## What we want

Please include (if possible) all of the following items (if applicable):
- WindowsPerf version you are using, e.g. output from `wperf --version` command.
- Your operating system name and version. On Windows click `Start` â€“> `RUN` , type `winver` and press enter. You will see a popup window with your OS version.
- The complete command line that triggers the bug.
- The Kernel driver debug logs. You can grab them with [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview).
- The MSVC toolchain warnings and errors present.
- Current `WindowsPerf` source code version. You can obtain it with `git log -1` command executed in the directory with the project solution file.
- Describe any limitations of the current code.

## What we do not want

- Screenshots, especially from text editors, command line tools, terminals. These can be copy/pasted as text.
- All sorts of attachments (binary file, source code).
